# SwiftUI Firebase Student App

## Fully Functional Sample! Froque App focuses on providing discounts and free extracurriculars within a user's community based off of a spreadsheet source.

## Inspiration
* The inspiration behind it was my own experiences. Coming from a first-generation student family, I was always obligated to find any discounts or free opportunities to capitalize on. However, these were not always available easily off the internet. A tool like Froque could help many individuals questioning to spend on something slightly over budget, for it to now become more managable.

## What it does
* Essentially, any activities or discounts are written on the app and linked to to that website in order to register.

## How we built it
* Using SwiftUI on XCode for the GUI, along with Firebase for the Authentication and database storage in order to update the app in realtime, effectively.

## Challenges we ran into
* The biggest challenge would have been connecting Firebase to the app. This required quite a bit of scrolling from the documentation, with some outdated versions providing incorrect code.

## What we learned
* Linking Firebase, force unwrapping vs. using guard statements, safe coding practices, designing,

## What's next for Froque
* I have so many ideas planned for Forque. Hopefully, using an AI model, I could easily update the discounts/extra-curricular activities within the area a lot easier. Not only that, but tailoring specific activities based on location would be an amazing idea.
